#summary Instructions how to get your build running

In order to successfully build Multi Theft Auto from source, it is necessary to perform a number of steps, which we will explain below.

== Prerequisites ==

Before you can build Multi Theft Auto, make sure you have the following software and SDKs installed:
  * Microsoft Visual Studio 2003 or 2005 (newer versions may work but are untested)
  * [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/directx/aa937788.aspx Microsoft DirectX SDK] (only the Direct3D related components are required)
  * [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsserver/bb980924.aspx Microsoft Windows SDK] or Platform SDK (only the DirectShow components are required)

== Checking out the repository ==

Start by checking out the code repository. Head over to the *Source* tab for more information about this. If you haven't already done so, install a client such as [http://tortoisesvn.net/ TortoiseSVN] to check out the source.

== Extracting the dependencies ==

Our project depends on a few third party libraries. These are packed in a separate SFX (self extracting) archive that can be downloaded through the *Downloads* tab.

Make sure you download the latest revision of the _multitheftauto_deps-rXXX.exe_ file and extract it into your repository root so the directories match up.

You will also need to extract the CEGUI libraries. Go to the _MTA10/dependencies/cegui_ directory and extract the _cegui-0.4.0-custom-lib.exe_ file in the same directory. The sources for these libraries are available as a separate download, but not required in order to build.

== Extracting the datafiles ==

If you want to run Multi Theft Auto, you will need to extract the data files that the project uses when it is launched. These are also packed in a separate SFX archive that can be downloaded through the *Downloads* tab.

Make sure you download the latest revision of the _multitheftauto_data-rXXX.exe_ file and extract it into your _Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_ directory.

== Building the source ==

In order to build the source, you will need Microsoft Visual Studio 2003 (higher versions have not been tested). Open the project file in *Shared/Core.sln* and build at one of the project configurations _Debug_, _Release_ or _Nightly_. Note that everything will run significantly slower in _Debug_ mode.

== Getting the network module ==

Since the _net.dll_ network modules for client and server are covered in a different license, you will have to get these from the *Downloads* tab.

Make sure you download the latest revision of the _multitheftauto_net-rXXX.exe_ file and extract it into your _Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_ directory. Bear in mind that these files are covered in a different license.
