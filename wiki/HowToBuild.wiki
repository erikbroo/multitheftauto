#summary Instructions on how to compile MTA yourself.

In order to successfully build Multi Theft Auto from source, it is necessary to perform a number of steps, which we will explain below.

== 1. Prerequisites ==

Before you can build Multi Theft Auto, make sure you have the following software and SDKs installed:
  * Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 (SP1 required)
  * [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/directx/aa937788.aspx Microsoft DirectX SDK] (only the Direct3D related components are required)
  * [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=0BAF2B35-C656-4969-ACE8-E4C0C0716ADB&displaylang=en Microsoft Platform SDK] (only the DirectShow components are required)

If you haven't already done so, install a client such as [http://tortoisesvn.net/ TortoiseSVN] to check out the source.

== 2. Checking out trunk ==

Start by checking out the [http://code.google.com/p/multitheftauto/source/browse/#svn/trunk trunk] code repository, as this contains the actual source code of the project. Head over to the [http://code.google.com/p/multitheftauto/source/checkout Source] tab for more information about this. 

*Example*: Check _http://multitheftauto.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/_ out to _c:\source\trunk_

== 3. Building the source ==

In order to build the source, you will need Microsoft Visual Studio. Open the project file in *Shared/Core 2008.sln* and build using one of the project configurations _Debug_, _Release_ or _Nightly_. Note that everything will run significantly slower in _Debug_ mode.

== 4. Getting the network module ==

Since the _net.dll_ network modules for client and server are covered in a different license, you will have to get these from the [http://code.google.com/p/multitheftauto/downloads/list?can=2&q=label%3ANet&colspec=Filename+Summary+Uploaded+Size+DownloadCount Downloads] tab.

Make sure you download the latest revision of the _multitheftauto_net-rXXX.zip_ file and extract it into your _Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas_ program files directory (not your GTA directory!). Bear in mind that these files are covered in a different license.

== 5. Running the software ==

You are almost ready to run your build of the Multi Theft Auto software.

=== Running the game client ===

If you want to run the Multi Theft Auto game client, you will need to extract the data files that the project uses when it is launched. These are also packed in a separate SFX archive that can be downloaded through the [http://code.google.com/p/multitheftauto/downloads/list?q=label:Data Downloads] tab.

Make sure you download the latest revision of the _multitheftauto_data-rXXX.exe_ file and extract it into your _Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas_ program files directory (not your GTA directory!).

=== Running the dedicated server ===

If you want to run the Multi Theft Auto dedicated server, you will have to install the required resources. These are required because they implement the most basic functionality  (e.g. spawning players) in order to play.

Our official resources repository is also hosted on Google Code: [http://multitheftauto-resources.googlecode.com/ multitheftauto-resources]. It's recommended that you check out the latest resources from here or download a zipped revision from the [http://code.google.com/p/multitheftauto-resources/downloads/list Downloads] tab on the resources project. Make sure that you are not using any of our resources from any previous versions of Multi Theft Auto, as this _will_ cause issues.

If you have any problems with missing DLL files (e.g. libcurl.dll), simply copy these over from the client's data archive described above.
